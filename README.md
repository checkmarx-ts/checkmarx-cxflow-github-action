## Secrets

_Note: It is recommended to leverage secrets for any sensitive inputs_
* checkmarx_url: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_URL }}
* checkmarx_username: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_USERNAME }}
* checkmarx_password: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_PASSWORD }}
* checkmarx_client_secret: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_CLIENT_SECRET }}
* github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
* sca_username: ${{ secrets.SCA_USERNAME }}
* sca_password: ${{ secrets.SCA_PASSWORD }}
* cxgo_client_secret: ${{ secrets.CXGO_CLIENT_SECRET }}
* jira_url: ${{ secrets.JIRA_URL }}

* jira_token: ${{ secrets.JIRA_TOKEN }}
* jira_project: ${{ secrets.JIRA_PROJECT }}


## Filters

Files can be excluded from the zipfile that CxFlow uploads to CxSAST by adding the `--cx-flow.zip-exclude` command line option to the `params` property in the GitHub Action configuration. The value of this option is a comma-separated list of regular expressions. Any file whose full path is matched by one of these regular expressions will be excluded from the zipfile.

The regular expression syntax is that used by the [`java.util.regex.Pattern`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) class.

Here is an example of filtering files:

```
--cx-flow.zip-exclude=\.git/.*,\.github/.*,apps/tests/.*,apps/docs/.*,apps/web/.*
```

This will exclude all files and subdirectories found under the `.git`, `.github`, `apps/tests`, `apps/docs`, and `apps/web` directories.

* Excluding the `.git` and `.github` folders from the zip file is highly important! Otherwise each commit will trigger a full scan due to changes in the files under these directories (which do not contain files that CxSAST will scan anyway).
* Do not enclose the list of regular expressions in quotes as these will be taken to be part of the regular expression(s).

The CxFlow log will show you the regular expressions used:

```
2023-01-25 03:14:45.232  INFO 8 --- [           main] c.c.f.u.ZipUtils                          [vLhiqdlb] : Applying exclusions: \.git/.*,\\.github/.*
```

If DEBUG logging is enabled, each matching file will be logged:

```
2023-01-25 03:14:45.240 DEBUG 8 --- [           main] c.c.f.u.ZipUtils                          [vLhiqdlb] : match: \.git/.*$1.git/HEAD
2023-01-25 03:14:45.240 DEBUG 8 --- [           main] c.c.f.u.ZipUtils                          [vLhiqdlb] : match: \.git/.*$1.git/index
2023-01-25 03:14:45.241 DEBUG 8 --- [           main] c.c.f.u.ZipUtils                          [vLhiqdlb] : match: \.git/.*$1.git/config
...
```

## Params
#### Example for params
Any remaining cx-flow parameters can be provided to params in the same way that they are passed in cli mode. To understand more about cli parameters, Please see [following](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Configuration#cli)

For a full list of all the cx-flow parameters, see the [following](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Configuration)
````yaml
# sample examples
    --sca.team ="/CxServer/Sca
    --jira.url ="https://xxxx.atlassian.net"
````
*Note:* Please use environment variables if any params values contain spaces.
#### Example for environment variable
```yaml
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    name: CHECKMARX
    # The type of runner that the job will run on - Ubuntu is required as Docker is leveraged for the action
    permissions:
      contents: read # for actions/checkout to fetch code
      issues: write # for checkmarx-ts/checkmarx-cxflow-github-action to write feedback to github issues
      pull-requests: write # for checkmarx-ts/checkmarx-cxflow-github-action to write feedback to PR
      security-events: write # for github/codeql-action/upload-sarif to upload SARIF results
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps require - checkout code, run CxFlow Action, Upload SARIF report (optional)
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Runs the Checkmarx Scan leveraging the latest version of CxFlow - REFER to Action README for list of inputs

        JIRA_FIELDS_0_JIRA_DEFAULT_VALUE : APPSEC-2371
        JIRA_FIELDS_0_JIRA_FIELD_NAME : "Epic Link"
        JIRA_FIELDS_0_JIRA_FIELD_TYPE : text

``` 
In given example as "Epic Link" contains space, hence it is used as environment variable and not passed in params.

In the environment variable format, each parameter is represented by a unique variable name. The variable names are constructed by converting the YAML path to uppercase and replacing any dots with underscores The square brackets and their index are removed. The parameter key is separated from the value by an equal sign

In the given example, the YAML parameter is transformed to the equivalent environment variable format. Each line represents a separate environment variable with its respective key-value pair.

To understand more about environment variable, Please see [following](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Configuration#env)
## Outputs

The default output format for this GitHub Action is a [SARIF](https://docs.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/sarif-support-for-code-scanning) output report stored in the working directory as **./cx.sarif**

For full documentation on all the supported output formats and defect management integration, please see the [following](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Bug-Trackers-and-Feedback-Channels).  

### `SARIF Report`

The file **_./cx.sarif_** is created containing issue details based on the filtering policy of CxFlow.  To make use of the report for CodeQL please make sure the [following is considered](https://docs.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github).  See sample useage below.

## Example usage

```
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Scan code with Checkmarx
    - name: Checkmarx CxFlow Action
      uses: checkmarx-ts/checkmarx-cxflow-github-action@v1.3
